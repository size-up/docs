# Delete workflow and all its runs

## Why delete an entire workflow?

- You have created experimental workflows in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository and you want to delete them permanently.
- You have accidentally leaked confidential information or credentials in the logs of a workflow and you want to erase them.
- You want to rename your workflow and don't want to keep the old name in the list of available workflows.

:::warning
Note that this operation is irreversible and you will lose all logs and artifacts associated with the deleted workflow. If you want to keep a record of your old workflows, you can archive them in a separate branch or repository before deleting them.
:::

We hope this documentation has been helpful for managing your GitHub workflows.

## How to delete a workflow

### Install the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
sudo apt install gh
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

```bash
brew install gh
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Log in to your GitHub account

```bash
gh auth login
```

Then, follow the instructions.

### Command to delete all workflows

:::caution
`GH_USERNAME_OR_ORG` is your GitHub username or organization name.
:::

```bash title="bash"
user="GH_USERNAME_OR_ORG" repo="REPO_NAME"; gh api repos/$user/$repo/actions/runs \
--paginate -q '.workflow_runs[] | select(.head_branch != "master") | "\(.id)"' | \
xargs -n1 -I % gh api --silent repos/$user/$repo/actions/runs/% -X DELETE
```

:::info
May need to re-run the command because of the rate limit of the GitHub API.
